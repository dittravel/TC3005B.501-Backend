    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS User (
        user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        user_name VARCHAR(20),
        creation_date FLOAT,
        -- Department where the user works
        department_id INT,
        FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES Department(department_id)
    );
```

Creating a SELECT Query: {#example-select-query}

```sql
    SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.name,
    u.email,
    d.department_id

    FROM
        User AS u
    JOIN
        Department AS d
        ON u.department_id = d.department_id
    WHERE
        u.name = 'Pedro Mauri'
        OR u.name = 'Salvador Vaquero';
```

Creating a SELECT Query with CASE: {#example-select-query-case}

```sql
    SELECT u.user_id,
           u.name,
           u.email,
           CASE
                WHEN u.user_id < 10 THEN 'First users';
                WHEN u.user_id > 100 THEN 'Last users';
                ELSE 'Other'
           END AS user_category
      FROM User AS u;
```

Creating a INSERT Query: {#example-insert-query}

```sql
    INSERT INTO User(user_id, name, email) VALUES
        (1, 'Pedro', 'mauri@tec.mx'),
        (2, 'Salvador', 'un_men@tec.mx'),
        (3, 'Fernando', 'nier@tec.mx'),

    DELETE FROM User
    WHERE
        name = 'Sosa';
```

Creating a BEFORE Trigger: {#example-creating-before-trigger}

```sql
    DELIMITER $$

    CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER [TriggerName]
    BEFORE [crud action] ON [TableName]
    FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
        IF [condition] THEN
            [query]
        ELSE IF [condition] THEN
            [query]
        END IF;
    END$$
```

        IF [condition] THEN
            [query]
        ELSE IF [condition] THEN
            [query]
        END IF;
    END$$
```

Trigger with OLD and NEW selected words: {#example-trigger-with-old-and-new}

```sql
    DELIMITER $$

    CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER ManageAlertAfterRequestUpdate
    AFTER UPDATE ON Request
    FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
        IF NEW.request_status_id IN (8, 9, 10) THEN
            DELETE FROM Alert
            WHERE request_id = NEW.request_id;
        ELSEIF OLD.request_status_id <> NEW.request_status_id THEN
            UPDATE Alert
            SET message_id = NEW.request_status_id
            WHERE request_id = NEW.request_id;
        END IF;
    END$$
```

Creating a VIEW: {#example-creating-view}

```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW [ViewName] AS
        SELECT
            [TableName].[RowName],
            [TableName].[RowName],

            GROUP_CONCAT(),
            GROUP_CONCAT()
        FROM
            [TableName1]
            LEFT JOIN [TableName2]
                ON [TableName1].[Row] = [TableName2].[Row]
        GROUP BY
            [TableName].[RowName],
            [TableName].[RowName];
```

## 1. SQL Reserved Words Rule

- Always use uppercase letters for SQL reserved words (CREATE, TABLE, INT, VARCHAR, SELECT, FROM, WHERE, AND, OR, etc.).
- This improves readability and consistency.

## 2. Naming Tables and Columns Rules

Check the example: [Creating a Table](#example-creating-table).

### Tables

- Use capital letters only for the first letter of table names.

- Do not use plural forms for table names.

### Table Elements (Columns)

- Use descriptive names for primary keys (e.g., `user_id`).

- Do not use capital letters in column names.

### General Naming Rules (Applies to both, Tables and Columns)

- Names should not exceed 10 characters when possible.
- Use underscores (`_`) only when necessary to separate words.
- Do not use plural forms for column names.
- Example: use `user` instead of `users`.
- Ensure the name is not an SQL reserved word. If necessary, wrap it in double quotes (`"`).
- Names must be unique. Do not reuse names across tables or columns.
- Do not use special characters (`$, &, *, etc.`).
- Do not start names with an underscore (`_`).
- Avoid abbreviations unless absolutely necessary.

## 3. Comments

- Avoid using comments unless absolutely necessary for explaining of a table, column, query, etc.

There are two ways to write a comment in SQL:

- For one line.

- For multiple lines.
  - Example:

  ```sql
  -- Single-line comment
  /*
  Multi-line comment
  */
  ```

## 4. Query Formatting Rules

### SELECT Query

Check the example: [Creating a SELECT Query](#example-select-query).

- Write SQL keywords at the beginning of the line, followed by the rest of the code. ('Keywords' | 'Rest of the code').

- If the `WHERE` clause has multiple conditions (`AND`, `OR`), write them in separate lines.

- Use `AS` for aliases when necessary for better readability.

- Use `JOIN` when a FOREIGN KEY is involved.

- Format `CASE` statements properly, aligning `END` with `CASE`. Check the example: [Creating a SELECT Query with CASE](#example-select-query-case). For this case.

### For INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE Queries

Check the following examples:

[Creating a INSERT Query](#example-insert-query).

[Creating a UPDATE Query](#example-update-query).

[Creating a DELETE Query](#example-delete-query).

- Use tabs before the values you want to `INSERT`. In the case of multiple lines of `VALUES`, use the tab for each.

- For `UPDATE` and `DELETE` queries, follow the `SELECT` query structure is not necessary, just separate them into multiple lines.

## 5. Triggers Formatting Rules

- The only tabs to use in triggers are; inside the logic code of the trigger (query and conditions), located between `BEGIN` and `END` selected words.

- There are two types of trigger; `BEFORE` and `AFTER` triggers, you have to determinate when you want to activate the trigger; before or after the crud function being in use.

Check the following examples:

[Creating a BEFORE Trigger](#example-creating-before-trigger).

[Creating a AFTER Trigger](#example-creating-after-trigger).

- `OLD` and `NEW` are special selected words for triggers in UPDATES, INSERTS and DELETEING queries. There are use to reference data that is beinging change in the data base.

Check this example: [Trigger using OLD and NEW](#example-trigger-with-old-and-new).

## 6. Views Formatting Rules

- Clearly separate the three main sections: `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `GROUP BY`.
- In the `SELECT` section, list columns and aggregation functions on separate lines.
- In the `FROM` section, indent each `JOIN` and its corresponding `ON` condition.

Check the example: [Creating a View](#example-creating-view).
